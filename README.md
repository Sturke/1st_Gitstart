# 1st_Gitstart 
Using this repo as a sandbox to practice learning next.js.

## Overview
This started by visiting Netlify again as a refresher. They don't appear to be presenting the 11ty template anymore. I might go back to that one day. We'll see. So, during my reading into using Svelte, I was learning that Vercel is the preferred hosting for Svelte. I also heard in the Syntax podcast that Vercel also seems to be the preferred host for next.js because as I understand it, Vercel maintains next. So, I found a next template and downloaded it. Reading and working through the next documentation, I haven't actually gotten to any next yet because I'm learning that it is based in React. In order for React to be able to be understood by the browser, you also have babel to somehow interpret or precompile the react.

Still just in the beginning of learning this tech
